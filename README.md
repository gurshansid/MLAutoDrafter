Our project is to build a machine learning based fantasy football auto-drafter that learns how to draft better teams by simulating thousands of historical drafts. The idea is that we collect real NFL player data such as age, past fantasy performance, injury history, boom and bust tendencies, draft capital, college production for rookies, team and QB changes, and more, and use that to train a model that makes draft decisions. At each pick, the model looks at the current draft state, our roster needs, and the features of all players still on the board. The neural network processes those features and outputs a probability distribution over all remaining players, meaning it gives every available player a probability that represents how good of a pick they are in that moment. The model does not choose players randomly. The probabilities come from a softmax over the neural network’s scores, which forces them to sum to 1 and creates a ranked set of draft preferences.

We simulate fantasy drafts using historical ADP for the other teams and let our system make picks based on the player data we have collected. After each simulated draft, we evaluate how well the drafted team would have performed in that real season using actual fantasy point totals. Over many simulations, the system adjusts its drafting strategy based on which types of players and decisions consistently lead to stronger teams. This lets it learn general drafting tendencies, such as when certain player profiles, like risky rookies, tend to help or hurt the final outcome.

Over many simulated drafts, the policy evolves into a drafting strategy that selects high reward players more consistently. The final result is a learned drafting policy that determines the best type of player to take in each round, based on real historical outcomes rather than fixed heuristics. All four team members participate directly in the AI components including data processing, environment design, model architecture, simulation, and training. The goal is a fully functional ML model that drafts teams based on learned probabilities rather than static rankings.
